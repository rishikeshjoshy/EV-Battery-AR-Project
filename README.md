‚ö° AR EV Battery Explorer
A Spatial Computing Interface for Immersive Visualization of Electrochemical Energy Systems
Developed using Unity Engine and Google ARCore Framework
üì± Executive Synopsis
This immersive extended-reality (XR) module offers a real-time, context-aware holographic representation of Electric Vehicle (EV) battery architecture. Designed for ed-tech ecosystems and professional training environments, the application visualizes lithium-ion cell topology, thermal management systems, and embedded electronics with interactive precision‚Äîelevating technical pedagogy and user cognition through spatial immersion.
üöÄ Feature Matrix
- Volumetric Projection of battery topologies via AR-enabled SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
- Hierarchical Exploded Views with contextual metadata overlays for BMS units, intercell busbars, and coolant loops.
- Dynamic Charge/Discharge Simulation mimicking real-time state-of-charge (SoC) flux and electrochemical gradients.
- Gesture-Driven Object Manipulation with quaternion-based rotational control and proximity-triggered UI affordances.
- Multi-Tiered Learning Layers including system diagnostics, parametric schematics, and lifecycle data extrapolation.
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- Unity Engine (version 2021) with XR SDK integration
- ARCore SDK for spatial anchoring and plane detection
- C# leveraging MonoBehaviour patterns and async coroutine workflows
- FBX model formats optimized through Blender for runtime performance
