# ‚ö° AR EV Battery Explorer

**A Spatial Computing Interface for Immersive Visualization of Electrochemical Energy Systems**  
Developed using Unity Engine and Google ARCore Framework

## üì± Executive Synopsis
This immersive extended-reality (XR) module offers a real-time, context-aware holographic representation of Electric Vehicle (EV) battery architecture. Designed for ed-tech ecosystems and professional training environments, the application visualizes lithium-ion cell topology, thermal management systems, and embedded electronics with interactive precision‚Äîelevating technical pedagogy and user cognition through spatial immersion.

## üöÄ Feature Matrix
- **Volumetric Projection** of battery topologies via AR-enabled SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
- **Hierarchical Exploded Views** with contextual metadata overlays for BMS units, intercell busbars, and coolant loops.
- **Dynamic Charge/Discharge Simulation** mimicking real-time state-of-charge (SoC) flux and electrochemical gradients.
- **Gesture-Driven Object Manipulation** with quaternion-based rotational control and proximity-triggered UI affordances.
- **Multi-Tiered Learning Layers** including system diagnostics, parametric schematics, and lifecycle data extrapolation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Unity Engine** (version XX.XX.XfX) with XR SDK integration
- **ARCore SDK** for spatial anchoring and plane detection
- **C#** leveraging MonoBehaviour patterns and async coroutine workflows
- **Firebase SDK** for telemetry and user behavior analytics
- **GLTF/OBJ** model formats optimized through Blender for runtime performance

## üß™ Deployment Protocol
1. Fork/clone repository to local machine.
2. Open via Unity Hub‚Äîensure Android Build Support and XR Plugin Management are enabled.
3. Configure target device for **AR-compatible APK** generation (preferably Android 10+ with ARCore support).
4. Deploy and launch the application; initiate surface scanning and instantiate holographic projection.

## üîÆ Future Augmentations
- BLE/IoT sensor mesh integration for real-time diagnostic overlays.
- Parallel module for LiFePO‚ÇÑ chemistry comparative visualization.
- NLP-powered voice-guided walkthroughs and multilingual contextual prompts.
- Enhanced analytics with cloud-sync for user heatmaps and flow insights.
